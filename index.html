	<h1>C programming tutorials</h1>
	<p>
	C is a powerful programming language that is ANSI/ISO standard for developing real-time applications. 
	In 1972, Dennis Ritchie designed the C programming language at Bell Laboratories. It was designed to implement the UNIX operating system. 
	Even now, C remains the most extensively used programming language. All other programming languages are either directly or indirectly built 
	on C programming basics. This C tutorial covers topics such as the history of the C language, data types, keywords, constants, variables, 
	operators, expressions, control statements, array, pointer, string, library functions, structures, and unions.
