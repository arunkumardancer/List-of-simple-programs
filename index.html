	<h1>C and Java programming tutorials</h1>
	<p>
	C is a powerful programming language that is ANSI/ISO standard for developing real-time applications. 
	In 1972, Dennis Ritchie designed the C programming language at Bell Laboratories. It was designed to implement the UNIX operating system. 
	Even now, C remains the most extensively used programming language. All other programming languages are either directly or indirectly built 
	on C programming basics. This C tutorial covers topics such as the history of the C language, data types, keywords, constants, variables, 
	operators, expressions, control statements, array, pointer, string, library functions, structures, and unions.
		
	The initial "official" C language was the "K & R" C, named after the names of the two inventors of the original "The C Programming Language." The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted a "new and improved" version of C in 1988, which is now known as "ANSI C". This is the version described in the current edition of "The C Programming Language — ANSI C.<br/><br/>
  
The default C method for showing output on the screen is the printf function. The quotations instruct the compiler that you want the literal string to be printed in its entirety (almost). For now, just keep in mind that there are a few sequences that, when they appear in a string literal, are actually not displayed literally by printf and that 'n' is one of them. The 'n' sequence is actually treated as a single character that stands for a newline (we'll discuss this later in more detail).<br/><br/>
The 'n' key really moves the pointer to the next line on your screen. The semicolon, which you should note, signals to the compiler that you have completed a task, such as a function call.

	<h2>Java programming tutorials</h2>
	<p>
	Unlike other programming languages that are compiled into platform-specific machines, like C, C++, and others. Java is a language that can be written once and run anywhere, without fail. During compilation, the Java program is transformed into bytecode. This bytecode format may run on any system and is platform-independent. Security is another benefit. Any machine with the Java Runtime Environment may run Java applications.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Java runtime enables software developers to write program code in languages other than the Java programming language, which still runs on the Java virtual machine. Java is defined by a specification and consists of a programming language, a compiler, core libraries, and a runtime (Java virtual machine). The Java virtual machine and the Java core libraries are frequently linked to the Java platform.
	</p>
	<p>
	Java source code (.java files) are converted to bytes by the compiler (javac) (.class file). As previously indicated, JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler. Any platform, such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc., may run this byte code. This implies that an application created for Windows may operate on Linux and vice versa. Although each operating system uses a distinct JVM, they all give the same results when bytecode is executed. Java is referred to as a platform agnostic language for this reason.

	The memory that is not referenced by other objects is automatically recollected by the JVM. The Java garbage collector searches through all object references for items that may be released automatically.<br/><br/>
While the garbage collector frees the programmer from having to actively manage memory, the programmer must still watch out for keeping unnecessary object references because if he does, the garbage collector won't be able to release the memory that goes with them. Memory leaks are sometimes referred to as keeping unnecessary object references.<br/>
	One class may be descended from another. This class is known as a subclass in this situation. A class extends another class is a further popular expression.A superclass is the class from which a subclass is descended. A class can adopt the traits and data specifications of another class through inheritance.
