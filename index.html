	<h1>C programming tutorials</h1>
	<p>
	C is a powerful programming language that is ANSI/ISO standard for developing real-time applications. 
	In 1972, Dennis Ritchie designed the C programming language at Bell Laboratories. It was designed to implement the UNIX operating system. 
	Even now, C remains the most extensively used programming language. All other programming languages are either directly or indirectly built 
	on C programming basics. This C tutorial covers topics such as the history of the C language, data types, keywords, constants, variables, 
	operators, expressions, control statements, array, pointer, string, library functions, structures, and unions.
		
	The initial "official" C language was the "K & R" C, named after the names of the two inventors of the original "The C Programming Language." The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted a "new and improved" version of C in 1988, which is now known as "ANSI C". This is the version described in the current edition of "The C Programming Language â€” ANSI C.<br/><br/>
  
The default C method for showing output on the screen is the printf function. The quotations instruct the compiler that you want the literal string to be printed in its entirety (almost). For now, just keep in mind that there are a few sequences that, when they appear in a string literal, are actually not displayed literally by printf and that 'n' is one of them. The 'n' sequence is actually treated as a single character that stands for a newline (we'll discuss this later in more detail).<br/><br/>
The 'n' key really moves the pointer to the next line on your screen. The semicolon, which you should note, signals to the compiler that you have completed a task, such as a function call.
